# HTMX Tailwind Components

This repo contains an HTMX-based Tailwind CSS Modal with transitions.
Maybe someday it will contain  more components.

To run the example, first install the http server with `npm install` and then start the web server with `npm run http-server`.

After that, access the application at http://localhost:8080. The example is also available at https://ryfow.github.io/htmx-tailwind-components.
